![Gotu](https://github.com/EkType/Gotu/blob/master/Promotion/Gotu_header.png "Gotu")

Rotund curves, large loops and voluminous counters. Gotu reimagines Devanagari calligraphy while at the same time reinterprets what high contrast Latin typefaces can be. Though the Devanagari is penned with a traditional canted nib, the structures are improvised with an expressive whim that belies conventions of structure and challenges notions of consistency. Swooping calligraphic strokes inspire forms that are lyrical without being too opulent. The same spirit resonates within a modulated but sans seriffed Latin as letters retain a calligraphic stress but not without delicate typographic quirks. Furnished with such typographic subtleties, Gotu can lend its distinct style to a quaint monograph, a striking headline, an ornate invite or even a chic brand.  

Gotu Devanagari is designed by Sarang Kulkarni and Gotu Latin by Kailash Malviya. Type design assistance and Font engineering by Maithili Shingre, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi. This project is led by Ek Type, a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces.

This font supports the Devanagari and Google Latin Pro glyphset.
